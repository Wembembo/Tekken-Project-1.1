                <td>Right now it initially loads on the left, which makes sense given its loading on a grid 
                    with nothing else to display until the character data populates, but it just looks 
                    a little janky. </td>

                    While its not high on the list, it isnt breaking anything, so I can work on this later.</td>

                    The plan is to have the video embed update depending on the player selection for player 1 and 2.
                    This will most likely be using a JSON file to create a 2d array for each matchup.</td>

                    (with the exception of Heihachi, he's just a lil' guy). I'm debating having the CSS pictures removed, 
                    and in their place have the full character art populate behind the table and meeting somewhere in the middle of the 
                    display. I would think that the CSS icons would need to remain for smaller screens. </td>

                    to have a gif show up of the move itself. This would be a lot of work on what is already quite a large project, 
                    so this is going to be fairly low down the list of prirorites until I'm happy with everything else first. </td>

                <td>At the moment, changing character (particularly on player 2 side) can result in changes to the width of the grid coloumns. This is unintended and will be fixed.</td>
